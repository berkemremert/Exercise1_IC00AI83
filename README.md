Week 1: Regulation and privacy on the web

Task 1: GDPR Data Request

1.	Which company did you choose to request your data from and how long did it take to submit that information?
I chose Medium.com, it’s a blog website for both personal and profitable use. I emailed them and there was an automated response first, then I created my request again via the link they provided with that automated e-mail. After my request, they responded via e-mail within an hour.
2.	In what format did you receive your data and how many pages/bytes of it were there?
They sent me .zip file inluding the following folders:
 
The files in those folders are in .html format.
3.	What kind of information was there that you had not directly given yourself?
-IP addresses I used
-My sessions (My active and inactive sessions)
-My X friends who are also on Medium
4.	Did you understand the meaning of the information?
Yes it was very simple and well-organized. They also provided me a roadmap to explain which file includes which informations.
 
5.	Do you think that the company collected the least amount of data required to provide the service you needed?
I think they are very open and transparent when it comes to keep the data. I read their privacy page on the website as well and I can say that they don’t keep any unnecessary information that bothered me.
6.	Were you surprised about something, what?
I was surprised about the IP addresses because I didn’t know that they were keeping that information however I understood why they do that afterwards. I looked up for it and found that it’s to protect themselves against syber attacks, also they understand if I am logging in from a new IP and asks an authentication code, so they protect my account as well.

Task 2: Cookie Raid

•	How many necessary cookies are there?
71
•	What happens if you try to disable necessary cookies?
It gives the following error:
Mandatory - can not be deselected. Necessary cookies help make a website usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the website. The website cannot function properly without these cookies.
•	List at least 6 different expiry times from the necessary cookies

Task 3: Browser Fingerprinting

Task 3 A) EFF Cover Your Tracks

•	Return two categories and results where you had the highest and lowest amount of identifying bits of information.
- Hash of canvas fingerprint (9,77)
- Hash of WebGL fingerprint (10,08)
•	Why does identifiability matter?
Identifiability matters because it can compromise privacy and security, making it easier for attackers to target individuals or misuse data.
•	What pros and cons can you think of to being unique vs common?
Pros of being unique:
-Stands out and attracts attention.
-Offers a sense of individuality and originality.
-Can lead to innovation and creative solutions.

Cons of being unique:
-May face resistance or rejection from others.
-Could be isolating or misunderstood.
-Might require more effort to maintain or explain.

Pros of being common:
-Easier to fit in and gain acceptance.
-Less likely to face criticism or resistance.
-Can offer stability and familiarity.

Cons of being common:
-May feel unremarkable or overlooked.
-Limited opportunities for standing out.
-Can lead to a lack of differentiation or uniqueness.

Task 3 B) AmIUnique

•	Canvas + WebGL Data
Canvas 	0.05 %	 
WebGL Data 	0.21 %	 

•	Screen width, Screen height
Screen width 	6.36 %	1440
Screen height 	5.65 %	900

•	Screen available width, Screen available height, Can you explain your result?
Screen available width	6.49 %		1440
-Returns the amount of horizontal space in pixels available to the window.
Screen available Height	0.07 %		825
-Specifies the height of the screen, in pixels, minus permanent or semipermanent user interface features displayed by the operating system, such as the Taskbar on Windows.

Task 4: TikTok Challenge (bonus)

Task 4 A) Analysing the HAR file

-Browser: Safari 16.3 
-Operating System: macOS 10.15.7 
-Screen Size: The screen size is not directly available in the logs. This information is typically accessed via JavaScript using window.screen.width and window.screen.height, which is not provided here.
-Local Language: The local language is not explicitly mentioned, but the presence of URLs like default.esm.js and captcha.js suggests the user might be using English or another common language supported by TikTok.
-Browser Language: English (Great Britain) 
-Region: The region can be inferred from the URLs and domains:
•	The use of tiktok-web-us in the URLs suggests the user is accessing the US version of TikTok.
•	Domains like byteoversea.com and ttwstatic.com are commonly associated with TikTok's global services, but the us in tiktok-web-us points to the US region.
-Timezone: The timezone is not explicitly mentioned in the logs. This information is typically accessed via JavaScript using Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone, which is not provided here.
-Search Keyword: pellesecurity

Task 4 B) TikTok data obfuscation

1)	I opened Tiktok on Firefox Developer Edition and from Developer Monitor / Network I copied the following cURL:
curl 'https://mcs-va.tiktokv.com/v1/list' -X POST -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:137.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/137.0' -H 'Accept: */*' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br, zstd' -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' -H 'Referer: https://www.tiktok.com/' -H 'Origin: https://www.tiktok.com' -H 'Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty' -H 'Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors' -H 'Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'TE: trailers' --data-raw '[{"events":[{"event":"window_size_change","params":"{\"page_name\":\"others_homepage\",\"enter_from\":\"others_homepage\",\"time_from_origin\":92354,\"is_landing_page\":0,\"previous_page\":\"search_user\",\"page_url\":\"https://www.tiktok.com/@pellesecurity\",\"userAgent\":\"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:137.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/137.0\",\"user_type_alias\":\"user\",\"domain_name\":\"www.tiktok.com\",\"page_path\":\"/@pellesecurity\",\"vidab\":\"70508271,73184477,73280492,73282495,73294390,73294937,73340490,73404637,73408307,73411239,73418134,73419053,73425708,73427272,73432220,73449066,73453775,73459765,73470036,73470127,73482194,73484781,73539009,70405643,71057832,71200802,73004916,73171280,73208420,73385640\",\"seo_vidab\":\"\",\"is_non_personalized\":\"0\",\"data_collection_enabled\":0,\"height_after\":408,\"width_after\":1280,\"play_mode\":\"three_column\",\"height_before\":658,\"width_before\":1280,\"prediction_payload\":\"0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1296000,1,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,18,2,1,0,0,0,1,1,0.96,1,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.93,0.99,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,14,2500000,16900000,2400000,43700,212200,540,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,14,2500000,16900000,2400000,43700,212200,540,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,7.6,7.6\",\"event_index\":1741707782155}","local_time_ms":1741707400814,"is_bav":1,"ab_sdk_version":"73410695,72901874,121503376","session_id":"33638a8e-a88e-4498-9670-26650bd2ffb7"}],"user":{"user_unique_id":"7480575891869861381","user_type":12,"user_id":"7480575647509644343","user_is_login":false,"device_id":"7480575891869861381"},"header":{"app_id":1988,"os_name":"mac","os_version":"10.15","device_model":"Macintosh","network_type":"","language":"en-US","region":"TR","platform":"web","sdk_version":"5.3.8_oversea","sdk_lib":"js","timezone":3,"tz_offset":-10800,"resolution":"1440x900","browser":"Firefox","browser_version":"137.0","referrer":"https://www.tiktok.com/search/user?q=pellesecurity&t=1741707356589","referrer_host":"www.tiktok.com","width":1440,"height":900,"screen_width":1440,"screen_height":900,"custom":"{\"session_id\":\"74805758918698613811741707309355\",\"webid_created_time\":\"1741707308\",\"app_language\":\"en\",\"page_name\":\"homepage_hot\",\"device\":\"pc\",\"launch_mode\":\"organic\",\"traffic_type\":\"google\",\"source\":\"\",\"referer_url\":\"https://www.google.com/\",\"browserName\":\"firefox\",\"hevcSupported\":1,\"cpu_core\":8,\"hardware_score\":7.6,\"total_score\":7.6,\"release\":\"1.0.2.4909\",\"user_is_login\":0,\"landing_page\":\"homepage_hot\",\"is_kids_mode\":0,\"region\":\"TR\",\"extraData\":\"{}\",\"is_downgrade\":false,\"is_sharing\":0,\"vidab\":\"70508271,73184477,73280492,73282495,73294390,73294937,73340490,73404637,73408307,73411239,73418134,73419053,73425708,73427272,73432220,73449066,73453775,73459765,73470036,73470127,73482194,73484781,73539009,70405643,71057832,71200802,73004916,73171280,73208420,73385640\",\"seo_vidab\":\"\",\"b_c\":\"0\",\"max_touch_points\":0}"},"local_time":1741707401,"verbose":1}]'

After encoding, I got the following Headers:
